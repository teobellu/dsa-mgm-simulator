This repository contains a learning tool through which it is possible to analyze the behavior of the main 1-coordinated algorithms described in [Maheswaran <i>et al.</i>, 2004], such as the Distributed Stochastic Algorithm (DSA) and the Maximum Gain Message (MGM) algorithm.

In this repository you can also find theoretical slides about the algorithms and further slides about the software.

Note: the first version of the software was presented on April 10, 2019, at the conference room (ground floor, building 20) of the Politecnico di Milano.
